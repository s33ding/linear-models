It measures how two variables, x and y, change together. If the variables tend to increase or decrease simultaneously, covariance is positive. If one increases while the other decreases, covariance is negative.

where 𝜇x and 𝜇y are the means of X and Y, respectively.

It is used for techniques like: PCA

**Covariance vs Correlation:** Covariance retains data scale (useful for variance calculations) but is hard to interpret due to units. Correlation standardizes covariance (range -1 to +1), making it unit-free and easier to interpret but losing scale information.
