Principal component analysis (PCA) is a linear dimensionality reduction technique that can be used to extract information from a high-dimensional space by projecting it into a lower-dimensional sub-space. If you are familiar with the language of linear algebra, you could also say that principal component analysis is finding the [eigenvectors](https://www.datacamp.com/tutorial/eigenvectors-eigenvalues) of the covariance matrix to identify the directions of maximum variance in the data.

One important thing to note about PCA is that it is an unsupervised dimensionality reduction technique, so you can cluster similar data points based on the correlation between them without any supervision (or labels).
